									<h2><a href="#">DATA CLEANING IN SQL<br />
									</h2>
									<p> Data Cleaning is one of the most important aspect of a Data Science job and my SQL project is exactly 
										about that. This SQL project was more advanced and exciting than the previous one, 
										and I learned a lot about the process of data cleaning. 
										I downloaded the dataset of Housing in Nashville, TN from github and 
										simplified it by removing duplicates and unused columns, standardizing the data, 
										and splitting columns into multiple individual columns that are more usable. 
										I used statements such as CONVERT, ISNULL, PARSENAME, CASE, ROW_NUMBER, and PARTITION BY, 
										and also created CTE.You can check out my SQL Data Cleaning project through this link: <br />

											<br />
									</a></h2>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images\charity.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
								
										<!-- Introduction -->
										<h3> Introduction</h3>
										<p>As a Data Analyst at "Education for All," I was tasked by the Head of Fundraising to leverage donation data to enhance insights into donor behavior and improve donation rates. My objectives were clearly defined: increase the number of donors, boost the frequency of their donations, and elevate the total value of donations. This analysis was crucial for the upcoming fundraising strategy meeting where strategies for the next year would be shaped based on my findings.</p>
										
										<!-- Task/Data Understanding -->
										<h3> Task/Data Understanding</h3>
										<p>Approaching the task, I focused on thoroughly understanding the provided datasets, <code>Donation_Data</code> and <code>Donor_Data</code>. These datasets included extensive details such as donor demographics, donation amounts, and donation frequencies. Using PostgreSQL, I familiarized myself with the data structure and relevant SQL commands, such as JOIN, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions like SUM() and COUNT(). This was vital for developing precise queries tailored to extract insights that could directly influence our fundraising strategies and meet the specific goals of increasing donor engagement and donation amounts.</p>
										
										<!-- Insights and Recommendations -->
										<h3> Insights and Recommendations</h3>
										<p>My analysis yielded several critical insights:</p>
										<ul>
										  <li>I determined the total donation amount was $249,085, indicating strong financial support for the charity, with a notable number of smaller donations pointing to a diverse donor base.</li>
										  <li>I observed varied donation patterns in amounts and frequencies, which pinpointed specific areas for potential growth and optimization.</li>
										</ul>
										
										<p>Based on these insights, I made the following recommendations:</p>
										<ul>
										  <li><strong>Increase the Number of Donors:</strong> Focus outreach efforts on the top contributing states and engage underperforming demographics through customized outreach strategies.</li>
										  <li><strong>Increase Donation Frequency:</strong> Analyze and understand the donation patterns of high-frequency donors to encourage similar behavior across a wider donor base.</li>
										  <li><strong>Increase the Value of Donations:</strong> Develop recognition programs for high-value donors and explore partnerships for matching gift programs to incentivize larger donations.</li>
										</ul>
										
										<p>These strategic recommendations were designed to leverage the detailed data analysis I conducted, utilizing PostgreSQL to ensure the effectiveness of our future fundraising efforts at "Education for All."</p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Lewis Stationery has established a robust presence in the office supplies industry, offering a diverse range of products from office essentials to maintenance and housekeeping equipment across numerous cities in the USA. In my role as a data analyst, I was tasked with dissecting various facets of the business’s performance, focusing on revenue patterns, sales volumes, and product popularity to unearth actionable insights.
    </p>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
        The core aim was to delve deep into historical data to extract a clear picture of the business's trajectory, providing Lewis with the necessary information to refine operational and strategic decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>To achieve this, I engaged in a detailed analysis process which included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Applying discounts to ascertain the adjusted revenue from each product category.</li>
        <li>Estimating total revenue by integrating a default price for products lacking specified pricing.</li>
        <li>Analyzing the order volume for the year 2015.</li>
        <li>Identifying the best-selling product of 2015 along with its category.</li>
        <li>Calculating the average price point of products that had no sales record.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Detailed Analysis</h3>
    <h4>Discounts and Revenue Adjustments</h4>
    <p>
        Products priced over $100 received a 10% discount, while those between $50 and $100 were discounted by 5%. Revenue calculations were then performed for each category.
    </p>

    <h4>Estimation of Total Revenue</h4>
    <p>
        A default price of $10 was assigned to products without specified prices to compute the total revenue.
    </p>

    <h4>Sales Volume for 2015</h4>
    <p>
        The analysis reviewed all transactions to determine the total number of orders placed in 2015.
    </p>

    <h4>2015’s Most Popular Product</h4>
    <p>
        The analysis identified the product that topped sales charts by quantity in 2015, noting both the product name and its category.
    </p>

    <h4>Pricing Analysis for Unsold Products</h4>
    <p>
        Average pricing was calculated for items that had not been sold to identify potential adjustments in stock levels or marketing focus.
    </p>

    <h3>Results and Implications</h3>
    <h4>Revenue Contributions by Category:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Office Supplies: $29,550</li>
        <li>Furnishings: $226,865</li>
        <li>Maintenance: $93,575</li>
        <li>Housekeeping: $50,413</li>
        <li>Public Area Items: $133,076</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Overall Revenue: $533,479</p>

    <h4>Order Count for 2015:</h4>
    <p>A total of 2,492 orders were noted.</p>

    <h4>Highlight of 2015 Sales:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Product Name: Large Vase</li>
        <li>Category: Furnishings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This analytical review has provided Lewis with the insights needed to optimize product pricing, enhance inventory management, 
		and target sales and marketing strategies effectively. 
		The report serves as a strategic tool to aid in making informed decisions for future business enhancements.

										<h2>Hotel Revenue Analysis </h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images\hotel.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project i cleaned and analyzed a hotel data. For this project
										 i aim to answer some business question <br>
										1. Is our hotel revenue growing by year? (Keeping in mind that we have two types of hotel) <br>
										2. Should we increase our parking lot size. <br>
										3. What customer type generate more revenue? <br>
										4 . What trends can we see in the data? <br>
										There are five tables in the data set.
										Firstly I extracted the data to SQL where I cleaned the data, applied CTE, UNION, LEFT JOIN statements, Numeric expressions to make the data more usable.
